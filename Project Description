Project Title: Ferns and Petals (FNP) Sales Analysis
Tool Used: Microsoft Excel (Dashboard with Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers)


Objective:
The objective of this project was to perform a detailed sales analysis for Ferns and Petals (FNP), a company specializing in gift deliveries for various occasions like Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Holi, Valentine's Day, Birthdays, and Anniversaries. The goal was to uncover key insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends to help optimize sales strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

Approach:
A comprehensive dashboard was created using Excel, incorporating interactive elements such as slicers (for Date and Occasion filters), pivot charts, and KPIs to deliver an intuitive and informative analysis. The analysis was structured around answering the following key business questions:

What is the total revenue generated?

How long does it take for orders to be delivered on average?

Which months perform best in terms of sales?

What are the top-selling products and categories?

How much does a customer typically spend?

Which cities place the most orders?

How does revenue vary across different occasions?

Key Findings:
1. Overall Sales Performance:
Total Revenue: ₹35,20,984

Total Orders: 1000

Average Customer Spend: ₹3,520.98

Average Order-Delivery Time: 5.53 days

2. Monthly Sales Trends:
Peak sales were observed in February and August, likely due to Valentine's Day and Raksha Bandhan celebrations.

Sales dropped significantly during the months of May, June, and July, suggesting low seasonal demand.

3. Top Product and Category Insights:
The top revenue-generating products included Deserunt Box, Dolores Gift, Harum Pack, Magnam Set, and Quia Gift.

Colors emerged as the highest-revenue generating category, followed by Soft Toys and Sweets.

4. Customer Behavior Analysis:
The average customer spending (₹3,520.98) indicates a mid-range product preference.

High spending during peak months suggests the importance of occasion-based marketing strategies.

5. Geographical Insights:
Top contributing cities by number of orders included Imphal, Dibrugarh, and Kavali, highlighting strong regional demand.

6. Revenue by Occasion:
Anniversaries and Raksha Bandhan were the most profitable occasions after "All Occasions" combined.

Diwali and Valentine’s Day also showed significant revenue, indicating strong festive-season performance.

7. Order Timing:
Peak order placements were observed around the late afternoon and evening hours, suggesting potential for time-based marketing campaigns.

8. Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time:
Further analysis could suggest if larger order volumes impact the average delivery time; however, an average of 5.53 days appears manageable.

Recommendations:
Boost Campaigns Around Peak Months: Focus promotional efforts in February and August.

Regional Targeting: Invest in localized marketing for top-performing cities like Imphal and Dibrugarh.

Occasion-specific Bundles: Develop customized product bundles for high-revenue occasions like Anniversaries and Raksha Bandhan.
